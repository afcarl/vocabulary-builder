vocabulary-builder is a simple script that collects words that occur the most frequently on a set of a crawled web-pages.

It works as follows: start on a set of web-pages, strips HTML tags, count occurrence of each word on a page, collect all links from the page, repeat the same process for all pages that had links from the first page.

This script can be helpful for collecting set of words that can be used later as inputs for neural networks.

Used libraries:
* stemming 1.0 - for word stemming
